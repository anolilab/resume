# Resume

This is the theme repository for the [Json Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) project. Unlike the [json-theme-boilerplate](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) project, this environment has a much improved developer environment to make editing your theme super to do.

## Installation

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for all its internal build processes. In theory, this project requires at lest Node v16 to run.

## Quick Commands

-   `pnpm dev` - Run the build and generate an résumé html page for development
-   `pnpm build` - Builds the résumé into a `html` file
-   `pnpm build:pdf` - Builds the résumé into a `pdf` file

## Creating your résumé.json

This project comes with `resume-sample.json`, which is a sample json resume you can build from. If you don’t create a `resume.json` file, it will automatically be created against the `resume-sample.json` file.

It’s highly **recommended** to create your own `resume.json` for your own resume. If you create a `resume.json`, this will automatically be used by the app instead. The `resume.private.json` file is automatically ignored from GIT to ensure you cannot check it in (since you’ll have personal information on there). If you do decide that you want to check it in, you can comment the following line in `.gitignore` like so:

```
# Keep your personal resume.json private
# resume.private.json
```

Please review the [schema here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) when creating your `resume.json`.

## Ignoring changes in resume.json

If you want to change the theme but don’t necessarily want to propagate the changes made in resume.json, you can untrack that file by running the following command:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged resume.json
```

If you want to track the file again, you can run:

```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged resume.json
```

## Generating an résumé locally

To generate an résumé locally, start the dev server (`pnpm run dev`) and print
the web page (<kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) as a PDF In fact, this <!-- textlint-disable write-good -->
is exactly how the PDF is generated by the pipeline. Since the pipeline uses <!-- textlint-enable write-good -->
[headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md#headless-chromium),
printing the résumé locally using Chrome will provide the most consistent
result.

## Why not use the PDF generated by the pipeline

The pipeline generates a PDF using the public information found in
`resume.json` and does not include any private data
specified in `resume.private.json`. (For example, phone numbers.)

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make the best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
