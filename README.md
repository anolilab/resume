My Résumé

## Data

All the content of this résumé is sourced from
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file loosely adheres to the
[`resume.json` schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) (with some additional
properties for display purposes). See the [resume.json](#resumejson) section
below for more info about `resume.json` compatibility.

Additionally, a `resume-data.private.json` file can be created alongside
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json). This file is `.gitignore`-ed; its
contents will be merged into [`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) when
building this résumé. This is used to protect personal info such as phone
numbers and addresses, while still allowing this data to appear in
locally-generated résumés.

## Generating a résumé locally

To generate a résumé locally, simply start the dev server (`yarn dev`) and print
the web page (<kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) as a PDF. In fact, this
is exactly how the PDF is generated by the pipeline. Since the pipeline uses
[headless
Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md#headless-chromium),
printing the résumé locally using Chrome will provide the most consistent
result.

### Why not just use the PDF generated by the pipeline?

The pipeline generates a PDF using only the public information found in
[`resume-data.json`](./resume-data.json) and does not include any private data
specified in `resume-data.private.json`. (For example, phone numbers.)
